**SwiftParcel
Certainly! Here are the step-by-step instructions to push all your changes to the remote repository:

1. **Stage Changes**: First, stage all your changes (both modified and untracked files) using the `git add .` command. This command stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories.

   ```
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit Changes**: Once your changes are staged, commit them with a descriptive message using the `git commit` command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

   Replace `"Your commit message here"` with a brief but meaningful description of the changes you made.

3. **Push Changes**: After committing your changes, push them to the remote repository using the `git push` command:

   ```
   git push
   ```

   If it's the first time pushing from this branch, you may need to use the `-u` option:

   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   This command tells Git to set up tracking between your local branch (`main`) and the remote branch (`main`).

By following these steps, you'll be able to push all your changes (both modified and untracked files) to the remote repository. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!
